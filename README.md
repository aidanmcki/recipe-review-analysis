# Introduction

This page details my investigation of a portion of the **Food.com Recipes and Interactions** dataset. 
I'm attempting to answer the question:
> "What kinds of recipes get high reviews?". 

I hope my analysis will reveal ideas about what kinds of recipes get rated highly, which may help writers create better performing recipes, as well as readers to recognize biases in others' reviews.
